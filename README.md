## Production

When we actually run this on the Pi, we need to run 

```
yarn add v4l2camera
```

in the server directory. I am developing on a Mac and that package does not support macOS. 


### Things to verify

- socket.io (and path, etc.)
- camera feed to server still works
- serial out from server still works
